# Scouting APP
With the Scouting APP you can make scouting of [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) robots and take reports from it. All the evaluation of the robots that you make are public, but you are anonymous, so everybody can get a precise general evaluation of the robots by combining all evaluations.

The app is a PWA, which means that you can use it in your browser, but you can also add it to your homescreen and use it offline, syncing the data when you're back online! Soon you'll have a option to download it from Google's Play Store and have it as a "normal" Android app.

# So, let's use it!
Access the [Scouting APP](https://ayrtonvwf.github.io/scouting-app), create an account if you don't have one, and go to the "Evaluation" section to start evaluating other team's robots. You can go to the "Reports" section to have a general view of the evaluations.

# Scouting API
A public api (which this app makes use of) is about to be turned into public, so anyone can download, read the docs, modify, explore and use it. The api is a public service, but it's still in beta. A link to it's git repository will be added here when it becomes to public. Watch out for it :)
